# Data Structures in C++

This repository contains basic implementations of fundamental data structures using C++. The goal is to understand how data structures work internally by building them from scratch without relying on STL containers.

## ğŸš€ Features

- Custom-built data structures like linked lists and trees
- File handling and keyword search functionality
- Focus on core logic, pointer manipulation, and dynamic memory management
- Console-based user interaction

## ğŸ›  Getting Started

To compile and run the code:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
